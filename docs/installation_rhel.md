# Installation Guide (RHEL)
This document can be used as a quick start guide to setup the development environment. Please review the system requirements listed below before moving forward with the FDO installation and deployment.

## System Requirements

| Component | Recommended |
|------- |------|
| Host Operating System | RHEL* (8.4, 8.6) |
| Podman* Engine | v3.4.2+|
| Podman* Compose | v1.0.3 |
| Maven* | 3.8.3 |
| Java | 11 |
| Haveged | - |

## Podman* Installation
Podman is included in the `container-tools` module. To install podman run the following commands:
```
sudo yum module enable -y container-tools:rhel8
sudo yum module install -y container-tools:rhel8
```

***NOTE:*** If you are working behind a proxy, ensure to set proper proxy variables in `/etc/environment` and `/etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf`



## Podman* Compose Installation
To install a specific version of Podman\* Compose (for example **_1.0.3_**) follow these steps:

1 . Download the specific version **(1.0.3)** of Podman* Compose.
```
sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/podman-compose https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containers/podman-compose/v1.0.3/podman_compose.py
```
2 . To apply executable permissions, run the following command.
```
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/podman-compose
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/podman-compose /usr/bin/podman-compose
```

## Other Development Tools

### 1 . To install OpenJDK*
```
sudo yum -y install java-11-openjdk-devel
```

### 2 . To install Maven*

1. Start by downloading the Apache Maven archive in the /tmp directory with wget command:
```
wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/maven/maven-3/3.8.3/binaries/apache-maven-3.8.3-bin.tar.gz -P /tmp
```
2. Once the download is complete, extract the archive in the /opt directory:
```
sudo tar xf /tmp/apache-maven-3.8.3-bin.tar.gz -C /opt
```
3. Create a symbolic link maven that will point to the Maven installation directory:
```
sudo ln -s /opt/apache-maven-3.8.3 /opt/maven
```
4. Set up the environment variables by creating a new file named maven.sh in the /etc/profile.d/ directory and paste the following code:
```
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jre-openjdk
export M2_HOME=/opt/maven
export MAVEN_HOME=/opt/maven
export PATH=${M2_HOME}/bin:${PATH}
```
5. Make the script executable by running the following chmod command:
```
sudo chmod +x /etc/profile.d/maven.sh
```
6. Load the environment variables using the source command:
```
source /etc/profile.d/maven.sh
```
7. Verify the installation
To verify that Maven is installed, use the `mvn -version` command which will print the Maven version:
```
mvn -version
```
You should see something like the following:
```
Apache Maven 3.8.3 (cecedd343002696d0abb50b32b541b8a6ba2883f)
Maven home: /opt/maven
Java version: 11.0.5, vendor: Oracle Corporation, runtime: /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-11.0.5.10-0.el8_0.x86_64
Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "linux", version: "4.18.0-80.7.1.el8_0.x86_64", arch: "amd64", family: "unix"
```

### 3 . To install Haveged
```
sudo yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
sudo yum -y install haveged
sudo chkconfig haveged on
```

## To Set Correct System Time
```
sudo date -s "$(wget -qSO- --max-redirect=0 google.com 2>&1 | grep Date: | cut -d' ' -f5-8)Z"
```

Ensure that the system time is correct, else you will receive the certificate expiration error.

Change Google* domain according to your location.
