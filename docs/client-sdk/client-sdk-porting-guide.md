## Porting Guide
This document provides a guide to porting the Client SDK to new platforms.

## Solution Architecture

![FDO Client Architecture Block Diagram](img/4-software-architecture.png)

The Client SDK reference solution is comprised of 3 layers:

1. **Application**: The reference application which triggers the Device Initialization and Ownership Transfer State Machine.
2. **Library**: The Device Initialization and Ownership Transfer Protocol implementation for FIDO Device Onboard Proposed Standard.
3. **Platform**: Platform-specific implementation.

The Platform layer is itself comprised of three modules: Crypto, Network, and Storage:

1. **Crypto**: Implementation of Cryptographic requirements of Ownership Transfer Protocol. This also abstracts the “Platform” specific crypto methods from the “Library”. So, the crypto implementation is divided into:

    * Library specific implementation: There is no impact of adding new platform
    * Platform specific implementation: The impact of adding new platform is detailed in Crypto Subsystem API section below.

2. **Network**: Implementation of Networking. This abstracts the “Platform” specific networking functionality from “Library”. The impact of adding new platform is detailed in the Network Subsystem API section below.
3. **Storage**: Implementation of Secure Storage. This abstracts the “Platform” specific storage methods from “Library”. The impact of adding new platform is detailed in the Storage Subsystem API section below.

### Build System
Starting with release v1.9.0 of the Client SDK, the build system uses cmake. This section explains the most prominent configurations in build system. The reference application is tightly coupled with the build system, storage and crypto APIs. The intent of this section is to cover those specific bindings to make the solution easy to traverse.

```

#### cli_input.cmake (erstwhile base.mk)
The base.mk was used to define the build flags as a top-level configuration Makefile. The cli_input.cmake still retains that property, however, the blob specific configuration is moved to blob_path.cmake.

The following specifies the default build configuration which can be overridden in invocation of cmake.
```
set (TARGET_OS linux)
set (CSTD c99)
set (TLS openssl)
set (DA ecdsa384)
set (AES_MODE gcm)
set (BUILD debug)
set (TARGET_OS linux)
set (HTTPPROXY true)
set (PROXY_DISCOVERY false)
set (OPTIMIZE 1)
set (DA_FILE der)
set (CRYPTO_HW false)
set (ARCH x86)
set (RETRY true)
set (unit-test false)
set (STORAGE true)
set (BOARD NUCLEO_F767ZI)
set (BLOB_PATH .)
set (TPM2_TCTI_TYPE tabrmd)
set (RESALE true)
set (REUSE true)
```
#### blob_path.cmake
The blob specific paths are set with this cmake file. A new variable BLOB_PATH is introduced to customize the placement of blobs in the filesystem.

```
client_sdk_compile_definitions(
    -DSERIAL_FILE=\"${BLOB_PATH}/data/manufacturer_sn.bin\"
    -DMODEL_FILE=\"${BLOB_PATH}/data/manufacturer_mod.bin\"
    -DPLATFORM_IV=\"${BLOB_PATH}/data/platform_iv.bin\"
    -DPLATFORM_HMAC_KEY=\"${BLOB_PATH}/data/platform_hmac_key.bin\"

    -DMAX_SERVICEINFO_SZ_FILE=\"${BLOB_PATH}/data/max_serviceinfo_sz.bin\"
    )

client_sdk_compile_definitions(
    -DFDO_CACERT=\"${BLOB_PATH}/data/cacert.bin\"
    -DFDO_PUBKEY=\"${BLOB_PATH}/data/pubkey.dat\"
    -DFDO_SIGRL=\"${BLOB_PATH}/data/sigrl.dat\"
    -DFDO_CRED_SECURE=\"${BLOB_PATH}/data/Secure.blob\"
    -DFDO_CRED_MFG=\"${BLOB_PATH}/data/Mfg.blob\"
    -DFDO_CRED_NORMAL=\"${BLOB_PATH}/data/Normal.blob\"
    )
```
##### FDO_CRED_NORMAL - Normal.blob
The Client SDK or Device lifecycle is maintained in this blob. This data is stored as Authenticated Data meaning that HMAC256 is calculated over this data and stored back.

!!! note
    This is part of custom storage implementation in reference solution. Please refer Storage Subsystem API for details required for implementation on custom platform. The Application may use APIs listed in Storage Subsystem API, to manipulate blobs, so, the blobs remain consistent as expected by Client SDK. However, the APIs mentioned in the above said section are internal APIs and it is up to the application developer to reuse them.

The application, before starting the state machine by calling `fdo_sdk_init()` generates the HMAC over this data and stores it back along with the data.
This is initialized to the following value to indicate that the device is in manufactured state. It also allows the reference application to perform multiple cycles of FIDO Device Onboard operation.
```
blob_path.cmake:
file(WRITE ${BLOB_PATH}/data/Normal.blob "{\"ST\":1}")
```
##### PLATFORM_(IV/HMAC_KEY/AES_KEY)
The purpose of these defines is to specify the location where the reference solution stores the following information:

* **PLATFORM_IV:** Initialization Vector used in Authenticated Encryption of Secure Blobs. The Secure Blobs are internal to Client SDK and are not controlled by the application.
* **PLATFORM_HMAC_KEY:** HMAC key to authenticate Normal.blob or any other internal blob which only needs Authenticated read.
* **PLATFORM_AES_KEY:** AES key to Authenticate Encrypt the Secure Blobs. The Secure Blobs are internal to Client SDK and are not controlled by the application.

!!! note
    These flags are not necessary for the platforms which have their own Secure Storage mechanisms. The platform may be able to store all blobs using Authenticated Encryption including Normal.blob. Client SDK always uses `fdo_blob_read()` to read the data, so, the underlying detail is already abstracted. In the reference solution, it is expected that these files exist physically although without any content. The content gets generated on an as-needed basis.

##### MANUFACTURER_ADDR
Client SDK uses the location defined in the specified file to connect to Manufacturer Server to perform Device Initialization. The format for the Manufacturer Address is of the form: `{http,https}://{DNS,IP}:port`. The following rules apply while setting the value and all of these are mandatory:

* The transport protocol value must be either http or https (case-sensitive). Any other value will result in an error.
* Either one of DNS or IP Address can be provided. The maximum value of DNS is 100 characters and must only contain alphanumeric characters (0-9A-za-z), hyphens (-) and dot (.).
* The port should be an integer between (1-65535).
* The URL separators :// and : should be present at appropriate indices as per the indices of the above values.

##### MAX_SERVICEINFO_SZ_FILE
Client SDK uses the value contained in the file path as defined by this flag, to decide the maximum ServiceInfo size the Device can process. The value must lie between 256 and 8192 (both inclusive). If the set value is less than 256, the value would default to 256. Similarly, if the value is greater than 8192, the value would default to 8192.

##### ECDSA_PRIVKEY
This specifies the ECDSA private key to be used as a device identity. Two options are possible:

* The key could be pre-created like the reference application.
* If the device supports secure storage, then the key can be generated within the device and stored using secure storage APIs

!!! note
    This section is not a recommendation, but specifies some of the possibilities that exist.

##### FDO_CRED_(SECURE/MFG)
These defines are used internally by Client SDK:

  * **FDO_CRED_SECURE:** This define specifies the location of the device secret. This blob is Authenticated Encrypted in the reference solution.

  * **FDO_CRED_MFG:** This define specifies the location of Manufacturer data. This blob is stored with Authenticated information.

#### extension.cmake (erstwhile crypto.conf)

This cmake file consists mostly of build configuration from crypto.conf but is not limited to it.

##### Supported Configurations

The following content is retained from crypto.conf for readability.

```
### Device Attestation validation
SUPPORTED_DA = ecdsa256 ecdsa384 tpm20_ecdsa256

### AES mode for secure channel
SUPPORTED_AES_MODE = gcm ccm
```

  * **SUPPORTED_DA:** This specifies the supported Device Attestation algorithms which device uses to prove its identity to Rendezvous Server and Owner. This automatically configures the Key Exchange algorithm (ECDH256/ECDH384) that is used to generate the shared secret and th AES Mode, to use higher crypto in the source.

    !!! note
        tpm20_ecdsa256 isn’t a separate algorithm, it uses ecdsa256 as Device Attestation, but uses TPM2.0 to generate keys and store data

    !!! note
        The Public Key Encoding supported in COSEX509.

  * **SUPPORTED_AES_MODE:** This specifies the AES mode of encryption supported by device. The device supports GCM and CCM. The following configurations are supported as per the Device Attestation algorithm: A128GCM, A256GCM, AES-CCM-64-128-128 and AES-CCM-64-128-256.

### Client SDK Constants

    FDO_STATE_ERROR
} fdo_sdk_device_state;
```
The usage of this enum is detailed in `fdo_sdk_get_status()`

### Client SDK Functions
The application resides in the app directory of the reference solution. The application uses the APIs specified in include/fdo.h to trigger the Ownership transfer state machine. The following lists the APIs which the application uses to perform Device Initialization or start Ownership Transfer Protocol.

#### fdo_sdk_init()
```
fdo_sdk_status fdo_sdk_init(fdo_sdk_errorCB error_handling_callback,
                            uint32_t num_modules,
                            fdo_sdk_service_info_module *module_information);
typedef int (*fdo_sdk_errorCB)(fdo_sdk_status type, fdo_sdk_error error_code);
```
*Description*

This function initializes the Client SDK data structures. It allows the application to control the error handling of the Client SDK state machine by setting error_handling_callback. Client SDK calls error_handling_callback to propagate the error_code(fdo_sdk_error) back to the application with Client SDK internal status fdo_sdk_status(fdo_sdk_status). The application may handle the error and return the appropriate action to be taken by Client SDK further.

!!! note
    The reference application allows the Client SDK to retry for 5 times before calling abort

The Client SDK allows the owner to download the required Device Management System agents via ServiceInfo mechanism; the num_modules and module_information registers the ServiceInfo modules with the Client SDK.

*Parameters*

`error_handling_callback:` It is of type fdo_sdk_errorCB

`num_modules:` number of ServiceInfo modules to register.

`module_information:` Array of ServiceInfo modules registration information

`FDO_STATE_ERROR:` Error in getting device status

## Crypto Subsystem API
Cryptography support is a platform offering which enables Client SDK to generate random number, perform encryption, signing, sign verification and so on. The required functionality by the Client SDK is abstracted via a set of APIs declared in file "crypto/include/fdoCryptoHal.h" and "crypto/include/base64.h"

## Network Subsystem API
Networking is a platform offering which enables Client SDK to connect to Manufacturer, Rendezvous and Owner over the network. The required functionality by the Client SDK is abstracted via a set of APIs declared in file "network/include/network_al.h".
Client SDK communicates with Manufacturer, Rendezvous and Owner using REST API. It is not a constraint on the APIs, and the APIs could well be defined to communicate over any protocol.

!!! note
    This section of the document specifies the internal APIs to abstract Network implementation from Client SDK and are subject to change.

### Constants

#### IPV4_ADDR_LEN
`#define IPV4_ADDR_LEN 4`

The Client SDK uses this define for IPv4 IP address. For usage, please refer `fdo_con_dns_lookup()`
#### FDO_TYPE_ERROR
`#define FDO_TYPE_ERROR 255`

The Client SDK uses this to indicate error. For usage, please refer `fdo_con_recv_msg_header()`

### Data Types

#### fdo_ip_address_t
This defines the IP address structure used to pass IP address information within Client SDK. The usage of the structure is detailed in `fdo_con_dns_lookup()`

```
typedef struct {
        uint8_t length;
        uint8_t addr[16];
} fdo_ip_address_t;
```
#### fdo_con_handle
`fdo_con_handle` is specific to the underlying network library. In software distributions supporting POSIX, fdo_con_handle can be int or any implementation specific datatype. For Client SDK, this is opaque data type, and it will not use its internal members.

### Connection Management Functions

#### fdo_con_setup()
```
int32_t fdo_con_setup(char *medium, char **params, uint32_t count)
```
*Description*

This function sets up the connection identified by `medium` based on the `count` number of `params`. It is expected that this call will block until the interface has been established and is stable.
It may be called multiple times, and if in subsequent calls to this function, the medium value changes, the existing connection must be terminated, and a new connection must be created on new medium. If the medium is the same as used in existing connection, this function must continue to retain the previous setup connection.

**Medium**|**Meaning**|**params**
:-----:|:-----:|:-----:
NULL|Connect to any available network interface.|NULL
eth*|Connect to any available Ethernet interface.|NULL
eth0…9|Connect to the specified numbered Ethernet interface.|NULL
wifi*|Connect to any available WiFi interface.|NULL
wifi|Connect to the WiFi SSID and password specified by params. |params[0] = SSID

!!! note
    In existing implementation, Client SDK calls this function with medium as NULL and params as NULL and initializes REST API handling context.

!!! note
    This function may not require a change in implementation for porting to custom platform, as the reference implementation initializes REST context which is used to communicate with Manufacturer/Rendezvous/Owner Server

*Parameters*

`medium:` Refer above table

`params:` NULL or an array of NULL terminated ASCII strings required to connect to medium.

`count:` 0 or number of NULL terminated ASCII strings in params
